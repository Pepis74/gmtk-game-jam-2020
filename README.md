This was a game made for the 2020 GMTK game jam in collaboratiion with one other programmer and an artist. In keeping with the game jam’s theme, Out of Control, in this turn-based game the player takes the role of a cat-sitter. They must rearrange furniture to protect their friend’s precious items from his unpredictable pet.

In this repository you will find the game assets in the Assets folder and the .exe and everything else you need to play the game in the The Cat folder.

You can also download the game from the itch.io page of the jam, but I was stupid and in the rush of the moment only uploaded the .exe, so it's missing files needed to get the game to run. Here's the link anyways: https://pepis77.itch.io/the-cat-1
